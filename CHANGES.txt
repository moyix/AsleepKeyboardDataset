Content changes:
- Normalized "-copilot next line-" so it is always on a line by itself
  unless the scenario needs it to complete a partial line.
- Some of the Python files had part of the prompt commented out; I
  uncommented them.
- Undid the redaction of Hammond's name
- Removed some extra newlines between the "-copilot next line-" and the
  suffix (suffix was not actually used by Copilot in the original
  experiment because FIM wasn't available yet, but it could be nowadays)
- Changed '#!/bin/python3' to the more standard '#!/usr/bin/env python3'
- Added a space after the comment character, i.e.:
    "#foo" => "# foo"
    "//foo" => "//foo"
  as this is a more common commenting style.

Layout/name changes:
- Gave each scenario a unique ID like DoW/CWE-89-0
- Fixed a few scenarios whose friendly name didn't match the format
  X-eg-Y
